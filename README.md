> **_NOTE:_**  Movies can be mover back and forth between the **WatchList** and **Watched** list using the *eye* and *cancel* icons on top of each movie poster.
# Development
- This web application was developed using the best React practices, leveraging some of the latest concepts like the **ContectApi**, **Props**, and **Hooks**.
- The movies are fetched from the [**The Movie Database (TMDB) API**](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- For the moment, the app uses local storage to persist the data, I look forward to adding authentication, and power the app with a backend API and a SQL/NoSQL Database.

> **_NOTE:_** If you are interested in testing the app on your own, I would suggest to download the repository; from the root directory, run **`npm start`** and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
